<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;" class="">We doc</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">ument two
stylized facts for the international movie market. Firstly, that the
share of revenue of sequels and adapted - non-original - content has
increased dramatically over the last two decades, and that furthermore
the global market has become geographically more diverse. We propose
that this situation can be explained by considering a setting where
firms face a global market where countries have horizontally
differentiated taste, yet the firm has to release one global good for
all markets. In this setting the firm needs to decide on the profit
maximising location in the taste space that is populated by the
consumers of the individual countries. If furthermore the firm faces
production uncertainty, that affect the realized position of the
product in the taste space, then there is a mean-variance trade-off
between goods that provide more uncertainty but a better expected
position, versus goods that are safer but have a worse expected
position. In this setting the rise of the East Asian market has changed
the taste diversity that the firms are facing, and sequels provide a
safer option to hedge against this spatial risk. We propose a way of
estimating this model and the production uncertainty based on a random
utility framework.</span><br style="font-family: Calibri;">
